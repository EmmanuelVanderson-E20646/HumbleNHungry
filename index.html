        <p id="myMessage" class = "col-md-6">I made this website for several reasons. To showcase some of the technical
        skills that I have at my disposal, first and foremost. This simple website 
        was obviously made with a combination of knowledge in HTML, CSS, and 
        JavaScript. Foundational knowledge when it comes to web development. I've
        chosen to combine this knowledge with newer skills I've gained in the cloud
        spectrum (I'm actually having a lot of fun learning and practicing this 
        type of stuff, I must admit). We have Amazon Web Services to thank for what 
        you are viewing here today.
        This website is hosted on Amazon S3. I created a custom domain name using
        Amazon Route53. Used an S3 bucket to host a sample website. Then I enabled
        static website hosting and directed the domain to that S3 bucket. Call me
        a nerd but this is pretty cool stuff to me. I'm going to keep working on
        this, of course! This is only the beginning!
        Also wanted to have a website that I host, all by myself, that I can do whatever
        with. Just thinking about the vastness of possibilities gets me excited! I think
        I'll start by filling that nav bar at the top with links to all sorts of things that
        I enjoy, so you can get a feel for my personality and interests all while
        assessing the skills that I had to utilize in order to make all of this happen.
        Well, by the time you see this, I'll be done. So go ahead and get started discovering
        my website, Humble&Hungry!
